# Accessibility Interview Questions  

Accessibility is a holistic practice. Ideally, a candidate should be able to answer some questions from each category, regardless of the role you are looking to fill.

Use these questions as jumping off points to discuss hows and whys. Learning how someone solves problems is far better than learning if they can recite specifications off the top of their head.

These questions are grouped into three buckets: [General](#general), [Technical](#technical), and [Design](#design). This may be a mistake, but we're going with it for now. Revise questions as needed per situation.
